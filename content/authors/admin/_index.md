I work as a data scientist at Seabury Consulting, part of Accenture. In my day-to-day work, I develop database and machine learning products used by leading clients in the (air) cargo industry. I possess a graduate degree in Statistics and Data Science from Leiden University. My interests include robust statistics, machine learning, deep learning and, more general, problem solving.
